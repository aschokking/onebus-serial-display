# onebus-serial-display
Script to poll the onebusaway API and send formatted results to a serial LCD from a raspberry pi

Requires onebusaway api key (http://pugetsound.onebusaway.org/p/OneBusAwayApiService.action) set via environment variable (`oba_key`) and a stops.json file with the following structure:

```
{ "stops":                               
  [                                      
      { "label": "Stop1", "id": "1_75502"}, 
      { "label": "Stop2", "id": "1_5622"}   
  ]                                      
}        
```

The code expects a serial lcd like this one from sparkfun to be attached to the pi: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9393
